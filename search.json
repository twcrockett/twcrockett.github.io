This research is pending later publication.\n\n\nSpace Silk Road\nPrevious research on this topic focused on the battle of influence between China and the US: how declining US interest, especially during the Trump presidency, led smaller satellite-operating countries to seek Chinese resources under the umbrella of the Belt and Road Initiative. The paper, as was presented at the WPSA and SPSA conferences in 2022, can be found here.\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nData science\nInternational relations\nInternational political economy\nMapping and environmental research\nPolicy\n\nSpace policy\nUrban planning/policy\nEnvironmental policy\n\n\n\n\nContact me"
