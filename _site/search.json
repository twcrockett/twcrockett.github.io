This research is pending later publication.\n\n\nSpace Silk Road\nPrevious research on this topic focused on the battle of influence between China and the US: how declining US interest, especially during the Trump presidency, led smaller satellite-operating countries to seek Chinese resources under the umbrella of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Look how the features are “right skewed,” meaning that a few huge outliers are present in our dataset (cough USA cough).\nIn the case of unsupervised machine learning, that might not prove to be an issue! But in the case of visualizing these things as human, these really large outliers are going to be distracting in later analysis.\nLuckily, I have a solution that doesn’t involve removing outliers. Why don’t we want to cut out outliers? Outliers, though “distracting,” are still an important part of the dataset! As we eventually make models, it’s important to remember that even the smallest and biggest programs are still parts of the ecosystem. Every model we will make is relative, and ignoring players is a certain way to draw bad conclusions.\nInstead, we can treat our data logarithmically, by applying \\({\\log (x)}\\) to columns with high skewness. This is called “normalization,” or making things more…normal. We want a nice, normal hill.\nSo, why is removing outliers not ideal, but logging okay? It’s because the relative structure and integrity of the data remains intact.\n\ndf.norm1 &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate_all(~log(. + 1))\n\ndf.scale1 &lt;- as.data.frame(scale(df.norm1))\n\ndist1 &lt;- Hmisc::hist.data.frame(df.norm1)\n\n\n\n\nNice. Everything looks a lot less visually distorted when logged, so I’ll stick with df.norm1 moving forward. (Note that our goal isn’t to achieve a normal distribution here: our data is neither normal nor log-normal, and we’re not trying to assume normality.)\n\n\nFind multicollinearity\nNow back to the multicollinearity I mentioned before. Multicollinearity isn’t necessarily a bad thing when it comes to unsupervised machine learning. In fact, in some models, it can be very informative. In general, though, it indicates the degree to which a dataset is redundant.\nIn this correlation matrix, a \\(1.00\\) indicates that there is perfect correlation. (Something will always be a \\(1.00\\) with itself.) A \\(0\\) indicates no correlation at all, and a negative number indicates the opposite direction of correlation.\n\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(df.norm1)\ncorrplot::corrplot(cor_matrix, method = \"number\")\n\n\n\n\nI’m happy with this. The fact that some variables have a relationship hovering around 0.2 or 0.3 tells me that this dataset is definitely worth exploring."

    "text": "Principal component analysis\nI’m not quite yet finished with multicollinearity. I’ll come back to it, but I want to take a moment to explain principal component analysis (PCA) and why it is useful for what we are about to do.\nIn essence, PCA boils down as many features, or variables, we have into that many dimensions. A dataset with 6 variables will be given 6 dimensions after a PCA. The math is a bit mathy, but the point is that we are seeing the “essentials,” or, quite literally, the principal components, by summarizing our variables.\nThe first dimension might be dominated by variable \\(x\\), while the second dimension might show that variables \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) pull against each other. Here’s my code to build a PCA:\n\npca &lt;- prcomp(df.norm1)\n\ncomponents &lt;- pca$x %&gt;% \n  data.frame() %&gt;%\n  select(PC1,PC2,PC3) %&gt;%\n  mutate(PC2 = -PC2)\n\nexvar &lt;- summary(pca)$sdev[1:3]\n\nloadings &lt;- pca$rotation %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PC2 = -PC2,\n    PC4 = -PC4\n  ) %&gt;% as.matrix()\n\nscaled_loadings &lt;- sweep(loadings[, 1:length(exvar)], 2, exvar, `*`)\n\nfeatures = scaled_loadings %&gt;% row.names()\n\ncorrplot::corrplot(loadings, method = \"number\")\n\n\n\n\nBreaking our dataset down into principal components gives us an idea of how our variables are related to one another. We can see that each successive principal component has different “loadings” respective to each variable. Principal components are in order of weight. PC1 will be the most influential, while PC5 has little, if any, real say in how our data are distributed.\nFunnily enough, budget_gdp_percent is a fat goose egg until the weakest component; the PCA is telling us that budget as a percent of GDP is a terrible measure to separate space programs. I’m prepared to call a FRAUD ALERT. Just to confirm that I’m justified in removing this variable outright, let’s consider a Euclidean distance measure of the loadings to see what amounts to be a “total influence” measure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnitude\n\n\n\n\nbudget_gdp_percent\n0.000\n\n\nbudget_capita_usd\n1.261\n\n\nactive_sats\n1.898\n\n\ninteractions\n2.056\n\n\ninteractivity\n0.504\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay…that’s even more pathetic than I expected. This procedure is part of good data processing! The loadings gave us enough to cut out our weakest feature, making the data process a bit easier moving forward. But to draw better conclusions, let’s turn to a visual that shows the different ways our other four variables influence the distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are there only 3 PCs for 4 variables?\nThere is a PC4, but the later components are weaker in importance, and we can’t visually show 4-D, so we choose to ignore it on the plot. Just because we aren’t showing it doesn’t mean we ignore it in the math later on, though.\nThis graphic is really telling! Observe how the countries are naturally falling on a general line from “big programs” to “small programs.” However, different variables have different influences.\nactive_sats, interactions, and interactivity roughly fall on a single plane, which makes sense: all three variables exclusively cover satellite activity, so in some way or another, they are going to be interrelated. Meanwhile, budget_capita_usd is nearly orthogonal (at a 90-degree angle) to this plane of satellite activity, showing us that space program budgets and activity are absolutely separate measures of space program size.\nAt face value after seeing this data, that might make sense. But classically speaking, a country with a bigger space budget should be launching more satellites, right? This PCA implies that things are actually much more nuanced."

    "section": "Clustering",
    "text": "Clustering\nOkay. We’re in good shape. The PCA has confirmed that something interesting is going on. Even better, PCA takes care of all the heavy lifting for the first type of clustering we’ll try.\n\n\\(k\\)-means clustering\nDon’t get too overwhelmed: it’s a simpler concept than you think. After breaking things down into principal components, we define \\(k\\) number of clusters ourselves, and the machine learning algorithm finds that \\(k\\) amount of central means around which \\(k\\) number of groups will form.\nThink of these clusters like mini solar systems. The little data points, or planets, hovering around get pulled into the mean’s, or star’s, orbit, so that we can visually separate them!\n\n\n\nA nifty MS Paint illustration. Source: Analytics Vidhya\n\n\nWait, wait, wait. How do we decide \\(k\\)? Do we just pull a random number out of a hat? Well…I guess we could. In theory, \\(k\\)-means clustering is robust enough to maintain some extent of validity no matter how many clusters we choose (even if it might be ugly or inconclusive).\nThere’s a better way, though. I’m going to use the neat NbClust package in factoextra that uses a series of indices to tell us ideal number of clusters.\n\nfviz_nbclust(df.norm1, kmeans, method='silhouette')\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the silhouette method tells us that 2 clusters is the ideal. Nonetheless, let’s consider the context of what we want to get out of the study. It would be nice to have a higher number of clusters that gives us a higher level analysis than “there is one strong group and one weak group.” Per the silhouette chart, \\(k\\) of 3, 4, or 6 aren’t bad choices either. For now, let’s try \\(k=4\\).\n\nplot_km &lt;- function(data, k, nboot = 2) {\n  \n  km &lt;- eclust(data, \"kmeans\", k = k, nboot = nboot)\n  \n  df_km &lt;- data %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      k_cluster = factor(km$cluster)\n    )\n  \n  # based on the PCA, I'm going to use interactivity, active_sats and budget as axes\n  km_fig &lt;- plot_ly(df_km, \n                    x = ~budget_capita_usd, \n                    y = ~active_sats, \n                    z = ~interactivity, \n                    color = ~k_cluster,\n                    mode = 'markers',\n                    marker = list(size = 6)) %&gt;% \n    add_markers(text = rownames(df_km)) %&gt;%\n    layout(\n      plot_bgcolor = \"#e5ecf6\"\n    )\n  \n  return(km_fig)\n}\n\nplot_km(df.norm1, k = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that out. We can see four machine-generated clusters. One, that includes the USA, France, and China, shows the stereotypical “big” space programs that have high levels of funding and activity.\n\n\nHierarchical clustering\nFor our final trick, let’s pull out another type of clustering. Hierarchical clustering makes a dendrogram, which is essentially a family tree of data points that shows close and distant relations. You can imagine that the “siblings” on the tree are very similar in the variables we have chosen, and the “distant cousins” aren’t.\nHow does an algorithm decide this family tree? There are two options when we hierarchically cluster.\n\n“Bottom-up” approach: the algorithm considers every country as an individual and looks for similar countries, grouping individuals into pairs then grouping pairs into larger clusters until the entire tree is connected.\n“Top-down” approach: the algorithm considers every country as one big group, and continuously finds differences to split them up until every single country is divided by those differences.\n\nFor this usage, I’m going with Ward’s minimum variance method, which is a type of “bottom-up” hierarchical clustering. If you really want to know, it uses the squared Euclidean distance between each data point to determine similarity.\n\n\nWhere \\(d_{ij}\\) is our distance measure:\n\\[\nd_{ij}=d(\\{X_i\\},\\{X_j\\})=||X_i-X_j||^2\n\\]\nSo why don’t I do some sort of test to see the “ideal” number of clusters? Unlike \\(k\\)-means clusters, where \\(k\\) directly influences the quality and integrity of the clusters, the hierarchical clustering algorithm is static, and the number of h-clusters I define is only for the purpose of visualization.\nThat’s because Ward’s method consistently computes distance. Take a look at our “family tree” below. It has a numerical y-axis labelled “Distance.” The farther the separation between two groups or countries, the farther apart they are in similarity. Look at the giant divide between the largest left and right groupings. The clustering algorithm determined that there is an extremely high-distance gap between the highest-output space programs and their younger counterparts.\nFor that reason, I find h-clustering to be more informative than \\(k\\)-means in this scenario. The family tree structure is visually powerful: for instance, take a look at the small grouping in blue of barely-funded African space programs, or the close pairing of China and India, two highly-funded but relatively young programs that are competing to break into the upper echelon of space-exploring countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour-tiered structure:\n\nRed: tier 1*\nGreen: tier 1\nPurple: tier 2\nTeal: tier 3\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis leaves us with four clear divisions between space programs. What exactly, can we conclude?\nFirst of all, a disclaimer: not much. There’s a tenet of “garbage in, garbage out” when it comes to unsupervised learning methods. Our initial dataset was both comprehensive and limited. The budget data and satellite data covered many countries, but we importantly lack futher variables. A space program shouldn’t be defined only by “number of satellites” and “amount of budget.” The data was also flawed in the sense that budget data is entirely dependent on accessible. While some governments are forthcoming and transparent with their data, many don’t even have an official website for their space program. We relied on consultant estimates for many of the programs, which is less than reliable going forward.\nSecond of all, a point of optimism: a lot. It’s important to approach quantitative methods qualitatively. Based on existing knowledge about space programs, the results line up! Even the surprises are pretty easy to explain. Did you know that France has the biggest satellite industry outside of Russia and the United States? What we can draw from these clustering methods needs an asterisk that this was to explore methodology rather than draw definite conclusions.\nOn the general left, there is a clustering of highest-performing space programs that we generally termed tier \\(1\\). Two highlights are Ukraine and Argentina, one of which has inherited some remnants of the Soviet space program and continues to make use of it, and one of which has benefited greatly from public-private cooperation and has separated itself from its peers across the Global South.\nTo the far left, four historically powerful countries whose rocketry and satellite programs originated from the Cold War era as well as the cumulative power that is the European Space Agency differentiate themselves as \\(1^{*}\\).\nOn the general right are space programs who are, across the board, less-funded and have a lower amount of output. To the far right is tier \\(2\\). These countries shouldn’t be overlooked, a many of them focus their lesser resources into well-honed specialties, such as Kazakhstan’s thriving launch industry, or Brazil’s specialization in environmental monitoring.\nTier \\(3\\) in teal consists of up-and-comers. The distinction of being in this grouping should be a proud one, as these programs have largely arisen from comparatively the fewest resources but have still escaped Earth’s atmosphere. These countries should be watched closely as prospective partners and many of their rises will be rapid.\nAs a final visualization, take a look below at all of our countries, recontextualized with their regions and attributed “tiers” from the hierarchical clustering. Does it line up with what you might expect?"

A silly wives’ tale, I told myself. Certainly, there was nothing to back it up. The legitimacy of an idea like clinical lunacy had long been debunked. But then I encountered another erratic driver on the way home, and checked Google. Sure enough, it was a full moon that day. It’s not that I’ve ever been truly been convinced, but the idea has long eaten at me, mostly because in my experience it has nearly always turned out to be true.\nA driver nearly runs me off the road? I check, and it’s a full moon that day. My friend gets slammed into at a red light? It happened on a full moon. And just a few months ago, I barely dodge the drunkest of drivers: it was a full moon. Even a handful of my most cynical friends have jumped on board the loony driver train.\nIt’s been years now, and I finally decided that I can’t let this gnaw at my brain any longer. So I did what any reasonable person would do with their first free weekend after graduating from undergrad: I collected data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s very robust Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), prepared a gradient boosting tree model, and constructed a hypothesis test."
