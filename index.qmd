### Research

##### Developing space powers

Most current research involves work about "developing space powers" (DSPs), or countries with burgeoning space programs, and how and where their development places them in regard to the space economy and international relations. This research is pending later publication.

##### Space Silk Road

Previous research on this topic focused on the battle of influence between China and the US: how declining US interest, especially during the Trump presidency, led smaller satellite-operating countries to seek Chinese resources under the umbrella of the Belt and Road Initiative. The paper, as was presented at the WPSA and SPSA conferences in 2022, can be found [here](https://twcrockett.github.io/SpaceSilkRoad_v2021.pdf).
