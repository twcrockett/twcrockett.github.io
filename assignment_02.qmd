Google Trends lets users decide between using "search terms" and "topics," but what's the difference?

### Using search terms

```{=html}
<script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"Biden","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"Trump","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"election","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"geo=US&q=Biden,Trump,election&hl=en&date=today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

### Using topics

```{=html}
<script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/012gx2","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"/m/0cqt90","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"election","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F012gx2,%2Fm%2F0cqt90,election&hl=en&date=today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

### Animals, cars and football

"Search terms" are single keywords, while "topics" are a group of keywords that Google curates as a better measure of true popularity. The difference in quality can be very pronounced when investigating non-distinct or very niche topics.
